## Layout - Surf and Paddle

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. For this project, The Iron Yard hired a designer to create a professional-looking landing page for a theoretical surf shop. Pixel precision is important.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you was able to:

* Understand the properties and use of many HTML tags
* Understand and be able to leverage many different CSS properties to style content
* Be comfortable with implementing layouts of HTML within CSS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you was able to effectively use:

* The `position` property and it's values
* The `display` property and it's values
* Google Fonts and Normalize CSS
* The Sip color picker (Mac application)

## Details

All of the assets needed are in the `assets/images` folder.

Used CSS reseting, which helps the positioning of all div's much easier.


Converted the mockup image (`surf-paddle.png`) into a living, breathing website. This is as pixel-perfect (in terms of position, font, color, spacing, borders, everything) as you it could.

I'll be using the PerfectPixel Chrome extension to compare your page to the mockup image; you should do the same as you're nearing completion.
